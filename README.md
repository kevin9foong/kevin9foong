<b>Description:</b> Thor not only has his own day (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens.  Popularly called Thor&#39;s Helmet, NGC 2359 is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor&#39;s Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like an interstellar bubble, blown with a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble&#39;s center. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Great Overdog. This remarkably sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from  narrowband filters, capturing not only natural looking stars but details of the nebula&#39;s filamentary structures. The star in the center of Thor&#39;s Helmet is expected to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime within the next few thousand years.    Almost Hyperspace: Random APOD Generator<br/>
