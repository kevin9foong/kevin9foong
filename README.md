<h3>:rocket:Ganymede from Juno</h3>

<b>Description:</b> What does the largest moon in the Solar System look like?  Jupiter&#39;s moon Ganymede, larger than even Mercury and Pluto, has an icy surface speckled with bright young craters overlying a mixture of older, darker, more cratered terrain laced with grooves and ridges.  The cause of the grooved terrain remains a topic of research, with a leading hypothesis relating it to shifting ice plates.  Ganymede is thought to have an ocean layer that contains more water than Earth -- and might contain life.  Like Earth&#39;s Moon, Ganymede keeps the same face towards its central planet, in this case Jupiter.  The featured image was captured in 2021 by NASA&#39;s robotic Juno spacecraft when it passed by the immense moon.  The close pass reduced Juno&#39;s orbital period around Jupiter from 53 days to 43 days.  Juno continues to study the giant planet&#39;s high gravity, unusual magnetic field, and complex cloud structures.    Follow Podcasts about APOD&#39;s Images: on YouTube<br/>
