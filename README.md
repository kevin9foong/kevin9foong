<h3>:rocket:A Season of Saturn</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Ringed planet Saturn will be at its 2023 opposition, opposite the Sun in Earth&#39;s skies, on August 27. While that puts the sixth planet from the Sun at its brightest and well-placed for viewing, its beautiful ring system isn&#39;t visible to the unaided eye. Still, this sequence of telescopic images taken a year apart over the last six years follows both Saturn and rings as seen from inner planet Earth. The gas giant&#39;s ring plane tilts from most open in 2018 to approaching edge-on in 2023 (top to bottom). That&#39;s summer to nearly the autumn equinox for Saturn&#39;s northern hemisphere. In the sharp planetary portraits, Saturn&#39;s northern hexagon and a large storm system are clearly visible in 2018. In 2023, ice moon Tethys is transiting, casting its shadow across southern hemisphere cloud bands, while Saturn&#39;s cold blue south pole is emerging from almost a decade of winter darkness.<br/>
