<h3>:rocket:An Eclipse Tree</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Yes, but can your tree do this?  If you look closely at the ground in the featured image, you will see many images of yesterday&#39;s solar eclipse -- created by a tree. Gaps between tree leaves act like pinhole lenses and each create a small image of the partially eclipsed Sun visible in the other direction.  The image was taken in Burleson, Texas, USA. Yesterday, people across the Americas were treated to a partial eclipse of the Sun, when the Moon moves in front of part of the Sun. People in a narrow band of Earth were treated to an annular eclipse, also called a ring-of-fire eclipse, when the Moon becomes completely engulfed by the Sun and sunlight streams around all of the Moon&#39;s edges. In answer to the lede question, your tree not only can do this, but will do it every time that a visible solar eclipse passes overhead.  Next April 8, a deeper, total solar eclipse will move across North America.   Album: Selected eclipse images sent in to APOD<br/>
