<h3>:rocket:Saturn&#39;s Hyperion: A Moon with Odd Craters</h3>

<b>Description:</b> What lies at the bottom of Hyperion&#39;s strange craters?  To help find out, the robot Cassini spacecraft that once orbited Saturn swooped past the sponge-textured moon and took images of unprecedented detail.  A six-image mosaic from the 2005 pass, featured here in scientifically assigned colors, shows a remarkable world strewn with strange craters and an odd, sponge-like surface.   At the bottom of most craters lies some type of unknown dark reddish material.  This material appears similar to that covering part of another of Saturn&#39;s moons, Iapetus, and might sink into the ice moon as it better absorbs warming sunlight. Hyperion is about 250 kilometers across,  rotates chaotically, and has a density so low that it likely houses a vast system of caverns inside.<br/>
