<b>Description:</b> Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity, published over 100 years ago, predicted the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. And that&#39;s what gives these distant galaxies such a whimsical appearance, seen through the looking glass of X-ray and optical image data from the Chandra and Hubble space telescopes. Nicknamed the Cheshire Cat galaxy group, the group&#39;s two large elliptical galaxies are suggestively framed by arcs. The arcs are optical images of distant background galaxies lensed by the foreground group&#39;s total distribution of gravitational mass. Of course, that gravitational mass is dominated by dark matter. The two large elliptical &quot;eye&quot; galaxies represent the brightest members of their own galaxy groups which are merging. Their relative collisional speed of nearly 1,350 kilometers&#x2F;second heats gas to millions of degrees producing the X-ray glow shown in purple hues. Curiouser about galaxy group mergers? The Cheshire Cat group grins in the constellation Ursa Major, some 4.6 billion light-years away.<br/>
