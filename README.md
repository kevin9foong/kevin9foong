<h3>:rocket:Expanding Plume from DART&#39;s Impact</h3> 
<b>Date:</b> 2022-10-05<br/>
<b>Description:</b> What happens if you crash a spaceship into an asteroid? In the case of NASA&#39;s DART spaceship and the small asteroid Dimorphos, as happened last week, you get quite a plume. The goal of the planned impact was planetary protection -- to show that the path of an asteroid can be slightly altered, so that, if done right, a big space rock will miss the Earth. The high brightness of the plume, though, was unexpected by many, and what it means remains a topic of research. One possibility is that 170-meter wide Dimorphos is primarily a rubble pile asteroid and the collision dispersed some of the rubble in the pile.  The featured time-lapse video covers about 20 minutes and was taken from the Les Makes Observatory on France&#39;s Reunion Island, off the southeast coast of southern Africa.  One of many Earth-based observatories following the impact, the initial dot is primarily Dimorphos&#39;s larger companion: asteroid Didymos. 	 Most recently, images show that the Didymos - Dimorphos system has developed comet-like tails.    DART Impact on Dimorphos: Notable images submitted to APOD<br/>
