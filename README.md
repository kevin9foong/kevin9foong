<h3>:rocket:Two Comets in Southern Skies</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2210&#x2F;2017K2_2022-09-21_media.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> Heading for its closest approach to the Sun or perihelion on December 20, comet C&#x2F;2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) remains a sight for telescopic observers as it sweeps through planet Earth&#39;s southern hemisphere skies.  First time visitor from the remote Oort cloud this comet PanSTARRS sports a greenish coma and whitish dust tail about half a degree long at the upper left in a deep image from September 21. It also shares the starry field of view toward the constellation Scorpius with another comet, 73P&#x2F;Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, seen about 1 degree below and right of PanSTARRS. Astronomers estimate that first time visitor comet C&#x2F;2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) has been inbound from the Oort cloud for some 3 million years along a hyperbolic orbit. Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is more familiar though.  The periodic comet loops through its own elliptical orbit, from just beyond the orbit of Jupiter to the vicinity of Earth&#39;s orbit, once every 5.4 years. Just passing in the night, this comet PanSTARRS is about 20 light-minutes from Earth in the September 21 image. Seen to be disintegrating since 1995, Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 was about 7.8 light-minutes away.<br/>
