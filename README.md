<h3>:rocket:All the Water on Planet Earth</h3>

<b>Description:</b> How much of planet Earth is made of water? Very little, actually. Although oceans of water cover about 70 percent of Earth&#39;s surface, these oceans are shallow compared to the Earth&#39;s radius. The featured illustration shows what would happen if all of the water on or near the surface of the Earth were bunched up into a ball. The radius of this ball would be only about 700 kilometers, less than half the radius of the Earth&#39;s Moon, but slightly larger than Saturn&#39;s moon Rhea which, like many moons in our outer Solar System, is mostly water ice. The next smallest ball depicts all of Earth&#39;s liquid fresh water, while the tiniest ball shows the volume of all of Earth&#39;s fresh-water lakes and rivers. How any of this water came to be on the Earth and whether any significant amount is trapped far beneath Earth&#39;s surface remain topics of research.<br/>
