<h3>:rocket:The Red Sprite and the Tree</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2309&#x2F;SpriteTree_Villaeys_1333.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> The sprite and tree could hardly be more different. To start, the red sprite is an unusual form of lightning, while the tree is a common plant. The sprite is far away -- high in Earth&#39;s atmosphere, while the tree is nearby -- only about a football field away.  The sprite is fast -- electrons streaming up and down at near light&#39;s speed, while the tree is slow -- wood anchored to the ground. The sprite is bright -- lighting up the sky, while the tree is dim -- shining mostly by reflected light. The sprite was fleeting -- lasting only a small fraction of a second, while the tree is durable -- living now for many years.  Both however, when captured together, appear oddly similar in this featured composite image captured early this month in France as a thunderstorm passed over mountains of the Atlantic Pyrenees.
