<h3>:rocket:The Orion You Can Almost See</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Do you recognize this constellation?  Although it is one of the most recognizable star groupings on the sky, this is a more full Orion than you can see -- an Orion only revealed with long exposure digital camera imaging and post- processing.  Here the cool red giant Betelgeuse takes on a strong orange tint as the brightest star on the upper left.  Orion&#39;s hot blue stars are numerous, with supergiant Rigel balancing Betelgeuse on the lower right, and Bellatrix at the upper right. Lined up in Orion&#39;s belt are three stars all about 1,500 light-years away, born from the constellation&#39;s well-studied interstellar clouds. Just below Orion&#39;s belt is a bright but fuzzy patch that might also look familiar -- the stellar nursery known as Orion&#39;s Nebula.  Finally, just barely visible to the unaided eye but quite striking here is Barnard&#39;s Loop -- a huge gaseous emission nebula surrounding Orion&#39;s Belt and Nebula discovered over 100 years ago by the pioneering Orion photographer E. E. Barnard.<br/>
