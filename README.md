<h3>:rocket:M1: The Expanding Crab Nebula</h3> 
<b>Date:</b> 2023-03-20<br/>
<b>Description:</b> Are your eyes good enough to see the Crab Nebula expand?  The Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first on Charles Messier&#39;s famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across today, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of over 1,000 kilometers per second. Over the past decade, its expansion has been documented in this stunning time-lapse movie. In each year from 2008 to 2022, an image was produced with the same telescope and camera from a remote observatory in Austria. The sharp, processed frames even reveal the dynamic energetic emission surrounding the rapidly spinning pulsar at the center.  The Crab Nebula lies about 6,500 light-years away toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).<br/>
