<h3>:rocket:Blue Supermoon Beyond Syracuse</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2309&#x2F;SuperBlueMoon_Saragozza_2000.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> The last full moon was doubly unusual. First of all, it was a blue moon.  A modern definition of a blue moon is a second full moon to occur during one calendar month.  Since there are 13 full moons in 2023, one month has to have two -- and that month was August.  The first full moon was on August 1 and named a Sturgeon Moon. The second reason that the last full moon was unusual was because it was a supermoon.  A modern definition of supermoon is a moon that reaches its full phase when it is relatively close to Earth -- and so appears a bit larger and brighter than average.  Pictured, the blue supermoon of 2023 was imaged hovering far behind a historic castle and lighthouse in Syracuse, Sicily, Italy.
