<h3>:rocket:To Fly Free in Space</h3>

<b>Description:</b> What would it be like to fly free in space?  At about 100 meters from the cargo bay of the space shuttle Challenger, Bruce McCandless II was living the dream -- floating farther out than anyone had ever been before.  Guided by a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), astronaut McCandless, pictured, was floating free in space.   During Space Shuttle mission 41-B in 1984,  McCandless and fellow NASA astronaut Robert Stewart were the first to experience such an &quot;untethered space walk&quot;. The MMU worked by shooting jets of nitrogen and was used to help deploy and retrieve satellites.  With a mass over 140 kilograms, an MMU is heavy on Earth, but, like everything, is weightless when drifting in orbit. The MMU was later replaced with the SAFER backpack propulsion unit.<br/>
