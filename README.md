<h3>:rocket:Gone in 60 Seconds: A Green Flash Sunset</h3> 
<b>Date:</b> 2023-10-25<br/>
<b>Description:</b> In 60 seconds, this setting Sun will turn green. Actually, the top of the Sun already appears not only green, but wavey -- along with all of its edges. The Sun itself is unchanged -- both effects are caused by looking along hot and cold layers in Earth&#39;s atmosphere.  The unusual color is known as a green flash and occurs because these atmospheric layers not only shift background images but disperse colors into slightly different directions, like a prism.  The featured video was captured earlier this month off the coast of Hawaii, USA. After waiting those 60 seconds, at the video&#39;s end, the upper part of the Sun seems to hover alone in space, while turning not only green, but blue.  Then suddenly, the Sun appears to shrink to nothing -- only to return tomorrow.<br/>
