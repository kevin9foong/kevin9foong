<h3>:rocket:Spiral Galaxy M74: A Sharper View</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Beautiful spiral galaxy Messier 74 (also known as NGC 628) lies some 32 million light-years away toward the constellation Pisces. An island universe of about 100 billion stars with two prominent spiral arms, M74 has long been admired by astronomers as a perfect example of a grand-design spiral galaxy. M74&#39;s central region is brought into a stunning, sharp focus in this recently processed image using publicly available data from the James Webb Space Telescope. The colorized combination of image data sets is from two of Webb&#39;s instruments NIRcam and MIRI, operating at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths.  It reveals cooler stars and dusty structures in the grand-design spiral galaxy only hinted at in previous space-based views.<br/>
