<h3>:rocket:Record Prominence Imaged by Solar Orbiter</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2203&#x2F;SunEruption_SolarOrbiter_960.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> What&#39;s happened to our Sun?  Last month, it produced the largest prominence ever imaged together with a complete solar disk. The record image, featured, was captured in ultraviolet light by the Sun-orbiting Solar Orbiter spacecraft. A quiescent solar prominence is a cloud of hot gas held above the Sun&#39;s surface by the Sun&#39;s magnetic field.  This solar prominence was huge -- spanning a length rivaling the diameter of the Sun itself. Solar prominences may erupt unpredictably and expel hot gas into the Solar System via a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME).  When a CME strikes the Earth and its magnetosphere, bright auroras may occur. This prominence did produce a CME, but it was directed well away from the Earth. Although surely related to the Sun&#39;s changing magnetic field, the energy mechanism that creates and sustains a solar prominence remains a topic of research.<br/>
