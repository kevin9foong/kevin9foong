<h3>:rocket:A Whale of an Aurora over Swedish Forest</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2203&#x2F;WhaleAurora_Strand_1500.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> What&#39;s that in the sky? An aurora. A large coronal mass ejection occurred on our Sun earlier this month, throwing a cloud of fast-moving electrons, protons, and ions toward the Earth. Part of this cloud impacted our Earth&#39;s magnetosphere and, bolstered by a sudden gap, resulted in spectacular auroras being seen at some high northern latitudes. Featured here is a particularly photogenic auroral corona captured above a forest in Sweden from a scenic perch overlooking the city of Ã–stersund. To some,  this shimmering green glow of recombining atmospheric oxygen might appear like a large whale, but feel free to share what it looks like to you.  The unusually quiet Sun of the past few years has now passed. As our Sun now approaches a solar maximum in its 11-year solar magnetic cycle, dramatic auroras like this are sure to continue.
