<h3>:rocket:The Once and Future Stars of Andromeda</h3>

<b>Description:</b> This picture of Andromeda shows not only where stars are now, but where stars will be. The big, beautiful Andromeda Galaxy, M31, is a spiral galaxy a mere 2.5 million light-years away.  Image data from space-based and ground-based observatories have been combined here to produce this intriguing composite view of Andromeda at wavelengths both inside and outside normally visible light. The visible light shows where M31&#39;s stars are now, highlighted in white and blue hues and imaged by the Hubble, Subaru, and Mayall telescopes.  The infrared light shows where M31&#39;s future stars will soon form, highlighted in orange hues and imaged by NASA&#39;s Spitzer Space Telescope.  The infrared light tracks enormous lanes of dust, warmed by stars, sweeping along Andromeda&#39;s spiral arms.  This dust is a tracer of the galaxy&#39;s vast interstellar gas, raw material for future star formation.  Of course, the new stars will likely form over the next hundred million years or so. That&#39;s well before Andromeda merges with our Milky Way Galaxy in about 5 billion years.<br/>
