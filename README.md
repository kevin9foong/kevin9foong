<h3>:rocket:Mercury&#39;s Sodium Tail</h3>

<b>Description:</b> That&#39;s no comet.  Below the Pleiades star cluster is actually a planet: Mercury. Long exposures of our Solar System&#39;s innermost planet may reveal something unexpected: a tail. Mercury&#39;s thin atmosphere contains small amounts of sodium that glow when excited by light from the Sun. Sunlight also liberates these atoms from Mercury&#39;s surface and pushes them away. The yellow glow from sodium, in particular, is relatively bright.  Pictured, Mercury and its sodium tail are visible in a deep image taken last week from La Palma, Spain through a filter that primarily transmits yellow light emitted by sodium. First predicted in the 1980s, Mercury&#39;s tail was first discovered in 2001. Many tail details were revealed in multiple observations by NASA&#39;s robotic MESSENGER spacecraft that orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015.  Tails, of course, are usually associated with comets.<br/>
