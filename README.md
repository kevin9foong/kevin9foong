<h3>:rocket:Jupiter over 2 Hours and 30 Minutes</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2401&#x2F;2024_01_15-Jup-2h30-Chronograph.png" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> Jupiter, our Solar System&#39;s ruling gas giant, is also the fastest spinning planet, rotating once in less than 10 hours. The gas giant doesn&#39;t rotate like a solid body though. A day on Jupiter is about 9 hours and 56 minutes long at the poles, decreasing to 9 hours and 50 minutes near the equator. The giant planet&#39;s fast rotation creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into planet girdling bands of dark belts and bright zones. You can easily follow Jupiter&#39;s rapid rotation in this sharp sequence of images from the night of January 15, all taken with a camera and small telescope outside of Paris, France. Located just south of the equator, the giant planet&#39;s giant storm system, also known as the Great Red Spot, can be seen moving left to right with the planet&#39;s rotation. From lower left to upper right, the sequence spans about 2 hours and 30 minutes.<br/>
