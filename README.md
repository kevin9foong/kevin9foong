<h3>:rocket:Shuttle Over Earth</h3>

<b>Description:</b> What&#39;s that approaching? Astronauts on board the International Space Station in 2010 first saw it far in the distance.  Soon it enlarged to become a dark silhouette. As it came even closer, the silhouette appeared to be a spaceship. Finally, the object revealed itself to be the Space Shuttle Endeavour, and it soon docked as expected with the Earth-orbiting space station.  Pictured here, Endeavour was imaged near Earth&#39;s horizon as it approached, where several layers of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere were visible. Directly behind the shuttle is the mesosphere, which appears blue.  The atmospheric layer that appears white is the stratosphere, while the orange layer is Earth&#39;s Troposphere. Together, these thin layers of air -- collectively spanning less than 2 percent of Earth&#39;s radius -- sustain us all in many ways, including providing oxygen to breath and a barrier to dangerous radiations from space.    Coming up Friday: Earth Day 2022<br/>
