<h3>:rocket:A Dust Jet from the Surface of Comet 67P</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2311&#x2F;Jet67P_Rosetta_2048.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> Where do comet tails come from?  There are no obvious places on the nuclei of comets from which the jets that create comet tails emanate.  In 2016, though, ESA&#39;s Rosetta spacecraft not only imaged a jet emerging from Comet 67P&#x2F;Churyumov-Gerasimenko, but flew right through it.  Featured is a telling picture showing a bright plume emerging from a small circular dip bounded on one side by a 10-meter high wall.  Analyses of Rosetta data show that the jet was composed of both dust and water-ice. The rugged but otherwise unremarkable terrain indicates that something likely happened far under the porous surface to create the plume.  This image was taken about two months before Rosetta&#39;s mission ended with a controlled impact onto Comet 67P&#39;s surface.<br/>
