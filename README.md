<h3>:rocket:Comet C&#x2F;2023 E1 ATLAS near Perihelion</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Comet C&#x2F;2023 E1 (ATLAS) was just spotted in March, another comet found by the NASA funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.  On July 1 this Comet ATLAS reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun. Shortly afterwards the telescopic comet was captured in this frame sporting a pretty greenish coma and faint, narrow ion tail against a background of stars in the far northern constellation Ursa Minor.  This comet&#39;s closest approach to Earth is still to come though. On August 18 this visitor to the inner Solar System will be a mere 3 light-minutes or so from our fair planet. Based on its inclination to the ecliptic plane and orbital period of about 85 years C&#x2F;2023 E1 (ATLAS) is considered a Halley-type comet.<br/>
