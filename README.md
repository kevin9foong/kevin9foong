<h3>:rocket:Red Crepuscular Rays from an Eclipse</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2205&#x2F;EclipseRays_Bouvier_1638.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> What&#39;s happening behind that island? Things both expected and unexpected. Expected, perhaps, the pictured rays of light -- called crepuscular rays -- originate from the Sun. Unexpected, though, the Sun was being partially eclipsed by the Moon at the time -- late last month. Expected, perhaps, the Sun&#39;s rays are quite bright as they shine through gaps in below-horizon clouds. Unexpected, though, the crepuscular rays are quite red, likely the result an abundance of aerosols in Earth&#39;s atmosphere scattering away much of the blue light.  Expected, with hope, a memorable scene featuring both the Moon and the Sun, superposed. Unfortunately, from this location -- in Uruguay looking toward Argentina -- clouds obscured the eclipse -- which wasn&#39;t completely unexpected.  However, after packing up to go home, the beauty of bright red crepuscular rays emerged -- quite unexpectedly.  Oh -- and that island on the horizon -- it&#39;s really two islands.<br/>
