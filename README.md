<h3>:rocket:Tails of Comet ZTF</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2301&#x2F;CometZtf_Hernandez_1395.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> Comet ZTF may become visible to the unaided eye. Discovered early last year, this massive snowball has been brightening as it approaches the Sun and the Earth. C&#x2F;2022 E3 (ZTF) will be closest to the Sun later this week, at which time it may become visible even without binoculars to northern observers with a clear and dark sky. As they near the Sun, comet brightnesses are notoriously hard to predict, though. In the featured image taken last week in front of a picturesque star field, three blue ion tails extend to the upper right, likely the result of a variable solar wind on ions ejected by the icy comet nucleus.  The comet&#39;s white dust tail is visible to the upper left and much shorter. The green glow is the comet&#39;s coma, caused by glowing carbon gas. Comet ZTF is expected to pass nearest the Earth in early February, after which it should dim dramatically.   Discovery + Outreach: Graduate student research position open for APOD<br/>
