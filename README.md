<h3>:rocket:Red Aurora over Poland</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Northern lights don&#39;t usually reach this far south.  Magnetic chaos in the Sun&#39;s huge Active Region 3664, however, produced a surface explosion that sent a burst of electrons, protons, and more massive, charged nuclei into the Solar System. A few days later, that coronal mass ejection (CME) impacted the Earth and triggered auroras that are being reported unusually far from our planet&#39;s north and south poles.  The free sky show might not be over -- the sunspot rich AR3664 has ejected even more CMEs that might also impact the Earth tonight or tomorrow. That active region is now near the Sun&#39;s edge, though, and will soon be rotating away from the Earth.  Pictured, a red and rayed aurora was captured in a single 6-second exposure from Racib√≥rz, Poland early last night.  The photographer&#39;s friend, seeing an aurora for the first time, is visible in the distance also taking images of the beautifully colorful nighttime sky.
