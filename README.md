<h3>:rocket:A Double Star Cluster in Perseus</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Few star clusters are this close to each other.  Visible to the unaided eye from dark sky areas, it was cataloged in 130 BC by Greek astronomer Hipparchus.  Some 7,000 light-years away, this pair of open star clusters is also an easy binocular target, a striking starfield in the northern constellation of the mythical Greek hero Perseus. Now known as h and chi Persei, or NGC 869 (above right) and NGC 884, the clusters themselves are separated by only a few hundred light-years and contain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun.  In addition to being physically close together, the clusters&#39; ages based on their individual stars are similar - evidence that both clusters were likely a product of the same star-forming region.<br/>
