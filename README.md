<h3>:rocket:Webb&#39;s Southern Ring Nebula</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Cataloged as NGC 3132 the Southern Ring Nebula is a planetary nebula, the death shroud of a dying sun-like star some 2,500 light-years from Earth. Composed of gas and dust the stunning cosmic landscape is nearly half a light-year in diameter, explored in unprecedented detail by the James Webb Space Telescope. In this NIRCam image the bright star near center is a companion of the dying star. In mutual orbit, the star whose transformation has ejected the nebula&#39;s gas and dust shells over thousands of years is the fainter stellar partner. Evolving to become a white dwarf, the faint star appears along the diffraction spike extending toward the 8 o&#39;clock position. This stellar pair&#39;s orbital motion has resulted the complex structures within the Southern Ring Nebula.<br/>
