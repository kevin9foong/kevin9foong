<h3>:rocket:DART: Impact on Asteroid Dimorphos</h3> 
<b>Date:</b> 2022-09-27<br/>
<b>Description:</b> Could humanity deflect an asteroid headed for Earth? Yes.  Deadly impacts from large asteroids have happened before in Earth&#39;s past, sometimes causing mass extinctions of life. To help protect our Earth from some potential future impacts, NASA tested a new planetary defense mechanism yesterday by crashing the robotic Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft into Dimorphos, a small asteroid spanning about 170-meters across. As shown in the featured video, the impact was a success. Ideally, if impacted early enough, even the kick from a small spacecraft can deflect a large asteroid enough to miss the Earth.  In the video, DART is seen in a time-lapse video first passing larger Didymos, on the left, and then approaching the smaller Dimorphos. Although the video ends abruptly with DART&#39;s crash, observations monitoring the changed orbit of Dimorphos -- from spacecraft and telescopes around the world -- have just begun.<br/>
