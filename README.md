<h3>:rocket:Earthrise 1: Historic Image Remastered</h3>

<b>Description:</b> &quot;Oh my God! Look at that picture over there! Here&#39;s the Earth coming up. Wow is that pretty!&quot; Soon after that pronouncement, about 53 years ago, one of the most famous images ever taken was snapped from the orbit of the Moon. Now known as &quot;Earthrise&quot;, the iconic image shows the Earth rising above the limb of the Moon, as taken by the crew of Apollo 8.  But the well-known Earthrise image was actually the  second image taken of the Earth rising above the lunar limb -- it was just the first in color.  With modern digital technology, however, the real first Earthrise image -- originally in black and white -- has now been remastered to have the combined resolution and color of the first three images.  Behold! The featured image is a close-up of the picture that Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders was talking about. Thanks to modern technology and human ingenuity, now we can all see it. (Historical note: A different historic black &amp; white image of the Earth setting behind the lunar limb was taken by the robotic Lunar Orbiter 1 two years earlier.)<br/>
