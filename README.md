<h3>:rocket:Europa and Jupiter from Voyager 1</h3>

<b>Description:</b> What are those spots on Jupiter? Largest and furthest, just right of center, is the Great Red Spot -- a huge storm system that has been raging on Jupiter possibly since Giovanni Cassini&#39;s likely notation of it 357 years ago.  It is not yet known why this Great Spot is red. The spot toward the lower left is one of Jupiter&#39;s largest moons: Europa. Images from Voyager in 1979 bolster the modern hypothesis that Europa has an underground ocean and is therefore a good place to look for extraterrestrial life. But what about the dark spot on the upper right? That is a shadow of another of Jupiter&#39;s large moons: Io. Voyager 1 discovered Io to be so volcanic that no impact craters could be found.  Sixteen frames from Voyager 1&#39;s flyby of Jupiter in 1979 were recently reprocessed and merged to create the featured image.  Forty-five years ago this August, Voyager 1 launched from Earth and started one of the greatest explorations of the Solar System ever.    Free Download: Voyager Posters<br/>
