<h3>:rocket:Good Morning Planets from Chile</h3>

<b>Description:</b> On June 15, innermost planet Mercury had wandered about as far from the Sun as it ever gets in planet Earth&#39;s sky. Near the eastern horizon just before sunrise it stands over distant Andes mountain peaks in this predawn snapshot from the valley of Rio Hurtado in Chile. June&#39;s other morning planets are arrayed above it, as all the naked-eye planets of the Solar System stretch in a line along the ecliptic in the single wide-field view. Tilted toward the north, the Solar System&#39;s ecliptic plane arcs steeply through southern hemisphere skies. Northern hemisphere early morning risers will see the lineup of planets along the ecliptic at a shallower angle tilting toward the south. From both hemispheres June&#39;s beautiful morning planetary display finds the visible planets in order of their increasing distance from the Sun.<br/>
