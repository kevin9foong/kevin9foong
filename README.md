<b>Description:</b> Wind-sharpened rocks known as ventifacts, cover this broad sloping plain in the foot hills of Mount Sharp, Gale crater, Mars. Dubbed gator-back rocks their rugged, scaly appearance is captured in these digitally stitched Mastcam frames from the Curiosity rover on mission sol 3,415 (March 15, 2022). Driving over gator-back rocks before has resulted in damage to the rover&#39;s wheels, so Curiosity team members decided to turn around and take another path to continue the rover&#39;s climb. Curiosity has been on an ascent of Gale crater&#39;s central 5.5 kilometer high mountain since 2014. As it climbs, it&#39;s been able to study layers shaped by water on Mars billions of years ago.<br/>
