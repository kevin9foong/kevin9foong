<h3>:rocket:Moon Phases 2022</h3> 
<b>Date:</b> 2022-02-01<br/>
<b>Description:</b> What will the Moon phase be on your birthday this year?  It is hard to predict because the Moon&#39;s appearance changes nightly.  As the Moon orbits the Earth, the half illuminated by the Sun first becomes increasingly visible, then decreasingly visible. The featured video animates images and altitude data taken by NASA&#39;s Moon-orbiting Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to show all 12 lunations that appear this year, 2022 -- as seen from Earth&#39;s northern (southern) hemisphere. A single lunation describes one full cycle of our Moon, including all of its phases. A full lunation takes about 29.5 days, just under a month (moon-th). As each lunation progresses, sunlight reflects from the Moon at different angles, and so illuminates different features differently.  During all of this, of course, the Moon always keeps the same face toward the Earth. What is less apparent night-to-night is that the Moon&#39;s apparent size changes slightly, and that a slight wobble called a libration occurs as the Moon progresses along its elliptical orbit.<br/>
