<h3>:rocket:Our Increasingly Active Sun</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Our Sun is becoming a busy place.  Only two years ago, the Sun was emerging from a solar minimum so quiet that months would go by without even a single sunspot.  In contrast, already this year and well ahead of schedule, our Sun is unusually active, already nearing solar activity levels seen a decade ago during the last solar maximum.  Our increasingly active Sun was captured two weeks ago sporting numerous interesting features. The image was recorded in a single color of light called Hydrogen Alpha, color-inverted, and false colored.  Spicules carpet much of the Sun&#39;s face.  The brightening towards the Sun&#39;s edges is caused by increased absorption of relatively cool solar gas and called limb darkening.  Just outside the Sun&#39;s disk, several scintillating prominences protrude, while prominences on the Sun&#39;s face are known as filaments and show as light streaks.  Magnetically tangled active regions are both dark and light and contain cool sunspots.  As our Sun&#39;s magnetic field winds toward solar maximum over the next few years, whether the Sun&#39;s high activity will continue to increase is unknown.<br/>
