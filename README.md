<h3>:rocket:Rings Around the Ring Nebula</h3>

<b>Description:</b> The Ring Nebula (M57) is more complicated than it appears through a small telescope.  The easily visible central ring is about one light-year across, but this remarkably deep exposure - a collaborative effort combining data from three different large telescopes - explores the looping filaments of glowing gas extending much farther from the nebula&#39;s central star. This composite image includes red light emitted by hydrogen as well as visible and infrared light. The Ring Nebula is an elongated planetary nebula, a type of nebula created when a Sun-like star evolves to throw off its outer atmosphere and become a white dwarf star.  The Ring Nebula is about 2,500 light-years away toward the musical constellation Lyra.   Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday? (post 1995)<br/>
