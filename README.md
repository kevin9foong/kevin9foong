<h3>:rocket:UHZ1: Distant Galaxy and Black Hole</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Dominated by dark matter, massive cluster of galaxies Abell 2744 is known to some as Pandora&#39;s Cluster. It lies 3.5 billion light-years away toward the constellation Sculptor. Using the galaxy cluster&#39;s enormous mass as a gravitational lens to warp spacetime and magnify even more distant objects directly behind it, astronomers have found a background galaxy, UHZ1, at a remarkable redshift of Z&#x3D;10.1. That puts UHZ1 far beyond Abell 2744, at a distance of 13.2 billion light-years, seen when our universe was about 3 percent of its current age. UHZ1 is identified in the insets of this composited image combining X-rays (purple hues) from the spacebased Chandra X-ray Observatory and infrared light from the James Webb Space Telescope. The X-ray emission from UHZ1 detected in the Chandra data is the telltale signature of a growing supermassive black hole at the center of the ultra high redshift galaxy.  That makes UHZ1&#39;s growing black hole the most distant black hole ever detected in X-rays, a result that now hints at how and when the first supermassive black holes in the universe formed.<br/>
