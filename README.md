<h3>:rocket:A Moon Dressed Like Saturn</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2208&#x2F;SaturnMoon_Sojuel_1824.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> Why does Saturn appear so big? It doesn&#39;t -- what is pictured are foreground clouds on Earth crossing in front of the Moon. The Moon shows a slight crescent phase with most of its surface visible by reflected Earthlight known as ashen glow. The Sun directly illuminates the brightly lit lunar crescent from the bottom, which means that the Sun must be below the horizon and so the image was taken before sunrise.  This double take-inducing picture was captured on 2019 December 24, two days before the Moon slid in front of the Sun to create a solar eclipse. In the foreground, lights from small Guatemalan towns are visible behind the huge volcano Pacaya.    News: APOD Receives First Outreach Prize from the International Astronomical Union<br/>
