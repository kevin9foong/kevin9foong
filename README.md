<h3>:rocket:Western Moon, Eastern Sea</h3>

<b>Description:</b> The Mare Orientale, Latin for Eastern Sea, is one of the most striking large scale lunar features. The youngest of the large lunar impact basins it&#39;s very difficult to see from an earthbound perspective. Still, taken during a period of favorable tilt, or libration of the lunar nearside, the Eastern Sea can be found near top center in this sharp telescopic view, extremely foreshortened along the Moon&#39;s western edge. Formed by the impact of an asteroid over 3 billion years ago and nearly 1000 kilometers across, the impact basin&#39;s concentric circular features are ripples in the lunar crust. But they are a little easier to spot in more direct images of the region taken from lunar orbit. So why is the Eastern Sea at the Moon&#39;s western edge? The Mare Orientale lunar feature was named before 1961. That&#39;s when the convention labeling east and west on lunar maps was reversed.<br/>
