<h3>:rocket:A Molten Galaxy Einstein Ring</h3>

<b>Description:</b> It is difficult to hide a galaxy behind a cluster of galaxies.  The closer cluster&#39;s gravity will act like a huge lens, pulling images of the distant galaxy around the sides and greatly distorting them.  This is just the case observed in the featured image recently re-processed image from the Hubble Space Telescope.  The cluster GAL-CLUS-022058c is composed of many galaxies and is  lensing the image of a yellow-red background galaxy into arcs seen around the image center.  Dubbed a molten Einstein ring for its unusual shape, four images of the same background galaxy have been identified. Typically, a foreground galaxy cluster can only create such smooth arcs if most of its mass is smoothly distributed -- and therefore not concentrated in the cluster galaxies visible.  Analyzing the positions of these gravitational arcs gives astronomers a method to estimate the dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters, as well as infer when the stars in these early galaxies began to form.
