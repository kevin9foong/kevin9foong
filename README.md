<h3>:rocket:Sh2-132: The Lion Nebula</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2406&#x2F;LionNeb_Badr_3720.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> Is the Lion Nebula the real ruler of the constellation Cepheus?  This powerful feline appearing nebula is powered by two massive stars, each with a mass over 20 times greater than our Sun.  Formed from shells of ionized gas that have expanded, the nebula&#39;s energetic matter not only glows, but is dense enough to contract gravitationally and form stars.  The angular size of the Lion Nebula, officially named Sh2-132,  is slightly greater than that of the full moon.  The gaseous iconic region resides about 10,000 light years away in a constellation named after the King of Aethopia in Greek mythology.
