<h3>:rocket:Aurora over Karkonosze Mountains</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2406&#x2F;AuroraKarkonosze_Koszela_1409.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> It was the first time ever. At least, the first time this photographer had ever seen aurora from his home mountains.  And what a spectacular aurora it was. The Karkonosze Mountains in Poland are usually too far south to see any auroras.  But on the amazing night of May 10 - 11, purple and green colors lit up much of the night sky, a surprising spectacle that  also appeared over many mid-latitude locations around the Earth.  The featured image is a composite of six vertical exposures taken during the auroral peak. The futuristic buildings on the right are part of a meteorological observatory located on the highest peak of the Karkonosze Mountains.  The purple color is primarily due to Sun-triggered, high-energy electrons impacting nitrogen molecules in Earth&#39;s atmosphere.  Our Sun is reaching its maximum surface activity over the next two years, and although many more auroras are predicted, most will occur over regions closer to the Earth&#39;s poles.<br/>
