<h3>:rocket:Fireworks vs Supermoon</h3>

<b>Description:</b> On July 4, an almost Full Moon rose in planet Earth&#39;s evening skies. Also known as a Buck Moon, the full lunar phase (full on July 3 at 11:39 UTC) was near perigee, the closest point in the Moon&#39;s almost monthly orbit around planet Earth. That qualified this July&#39;s Full Moon as a supermoon, the first of four supermoons in 2023. Seen from Cocoa Beach along Florida&#39;s Space Coast on July 4, any big, bright, beautiful Full Moon would still have to compete for attention though. July&#39;s super-moonrise was captured here against a super-colorful fireworks display.<br/>
