<h3>:rocket:The Milky Way&#39;s Black Hole</h3>

<b>Description:</b> There&#39;s a black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Stars are observed to orbit a very massive and compact object there known as Sgr A* (say &quot;sadge-ay-star&quot;). But this just released radio image (inset) from planet Earth&#39;s Event Horizon Telescope is the first direct evidence of the Milky Way&#39;s central black hole. As predicted by Einstein&#39;s Theory of General Relativity, the four million solar mass black hole&#39;s strong gravity is bending light and creating a shadow-like dark central region surrounded by a bright ring-like structure. Supporting observations made by space-based telescopes and ground-based observatories provide a wider view of the galactic center&#39;s dynamic environment and an important context for the Event Horizon Telescope&#39;s black hole image. The main panel image shows the X-ray data from Chandra and infrared data from Hubble. While the main panel is about 7 light-years across, the Event Horizon Telescope inset image itself spans a mere 10 light-minutes at the center of our galaxy, some 27,000 light-years away.<br/>
