<h3>:rocket:The Pleiades: Seven Dusty Sisters</h3>

<b>Description:</b> The well-known Pleiades star cluster is slowly destroying part of a passing cloud of gas and dust. The Pleiades is the brightest open cluster of stars on Earth&#39;s sky and can be seen from almost any northerly location with the unaided eye.  Over the past 100,000 years, a field of gas and dust is moving by chance right through the Pleiades star cluster and is causing a strong reaction between the stars and dust. The passing cloud might be part of the Radcliffe wave, a newly discovered structure of gas and dust connecting several regions of star formation in the nearby part of our Milky Way galaxy.  Pressure from the stars&#39; light significantly repels the dust in the surrounding blue reflection nebula, with smaller dust particles being repelled more strongly.  A short-term result is that parts of the dust cloud have become filamentary and stratified. The featured deep image incorporates nearly 9 hours of exposure and was captured from Utah Desert Remote Observatory in Utah, USA, last year.<br/>
