<h3>:rocket:The Changing Ion Tail of Comet Pons-Brooks</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2404&#x2F;Comet12pTails_ShengyuLi_3000.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> How does a comet tail change? It depends on the comet.  The ion tail of Comet 12P&#x2F;Ponsâ€“Brooks has been changing markedly, as detailed in the featured image sequenced over nine days from March 6 to 14 (top to bottom).  On some days, the comet&#39;s ion tail was relatively long and complex, but not every day.  Reasons for tail changes include the rate of ejection of material from the comet&#39;s nucleus, the strength and complexity of the passing solar wind, and the rotation rate of the comet.  Over the course of a week, apparent changes even include a change of perspective from the Earth. In general, a comet&#39;s ion tail will point away from the Sun, as gas expelled is pushed out by the Sun&#39;s wind. Today, Pons-Brooks may become a rare comet suddenly visible in the middle of the day for those able to see the Sun totally eclipsed by the Moon.
