<h3>:rocket:SLIM Lands on the Moon</h3>

<b>Description:</b> New landers are on the Moon. Nearly two weeks ago, Japan&#39;s Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) released two rovers as it descended, before its main lander touched down itself. The larger of the two rovers can hop like a frog, while the smaller rover is about the size of a baseball and can move after pulling itself apart like a transformer. The main lander, nicknamed Moon Sniper, is seen in the featured image taken by the smaller rover. Inspection of the image shows that Moon Sniper&#39;s thrusters are facing up, meaning that the lander is upside down from its descent configuration and on its side from its intended landing configuration.  One result is that Moon Sniper&#39;s solar panels are not in the expected orientation, so that powering the lander had to be curtailed and adapted.  SLIM&#39;s lander has already succeeded as a technology demonstration, its main mission, but was not designed to withstand the lunar night -- which starts tomorrow.<br/>
