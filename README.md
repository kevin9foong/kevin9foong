<h3>:rocket:Halloween and the Wizard Nebula</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Halloween&#39;s origin is ancient and astronomical.  Since the fifth century BC, Halloween has been celebrated as a cross-quarter day, a day halfway between an equinox (equal day &#x2F; equal night) and a solstice (minimum day &#x2F; maximum night in the northern hemisphere).  With a modern calendar however, even though Halloween occurs today, the real cross-quarter day will occur next week.  Another cross-quarter day is Groundhog Day. Halloween&#39;s modern celebration retains historic roots in dressing to scare away the spirits of the dead.  Perhaps a fitting tribute to this ancient holiday is this closeup view of the Wizard Nebula (NGC 7380).  Visually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a fictional ancient sorcerer. Although the nebula may last only a few million years, some of the stars being conjured from the gas by the great gravitational powers may outlive our Sun.<br/>
