<h3>:rocket:Earendel: A Star in the Early Universe</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2204&#x2F;LensedStar_Hubble_960.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> Is Earendel the farthest star yet discovered? This scientific possibility started when the Hubble Space Telescope observed a huge cluster of galaxies. The gravitational lens effect of this cluster was seen to magnify and distort a galaxy far in the background. This distorted background galaxy -- so far away it has a redshift of 6.2 -- appears in the featured image as a long red string, while beads on that string are likely to be star clusters.   The galaxy cluster lens creates a line of maximum magnification line where superposed background objects may appear magnified many thousands of times. On the intersection between the galaxy line and the maximum magnification line is one &quot;bead&quot; which shows evidence of originating from a single bright star in the early universe -- now named Earendel. Future investigations may include more imaging by Hubble to see how Earendel&#39;s brightness varies, and, quite possibly, by the new James Webb Space Telescope when it becomes operational later this year.  Earendel&#39;s  great distance exceeds that of any known stable star -- although the star that exploded creating GRB 090423 had a redshift of 8.2.<br/>
