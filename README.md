<h3>:rocket:Moon Meets Jupiter</h3>

<b>Description:</b> What&#39;s that below the Moon? Jupiter -- and its largest moons.  Many skygazers across planet Earth enjoyed the close conjunction of Earth&#39;s Moon passing nearly in front of Jupiter in mid-June. The featured image is a single exposure of the event taken from Mor√≥n de la Frontera, Spain. The sunlit lunar crescent on the left is overexposed, while the Moon&#39;s night side, on the right, is only faintly illuminated by Earthshine. Lined up diagonally below the Moon, left to right, are Jupiter&#39;s bright Galilean satellites: Callisto, Ganymede, Io (hard to see as it is very near to Jupiter), and Europa.  In fact, Callisto, Ganymede, and Io are larger than Earth&#39;s Moon, while Europa is only slightly smaller. NASA&#39;s robotic spacecraft Juno is currently orbiting Jupiter and made a close pass near Io only a week ago.  If you look up in the night sky tonight, you will again see two of the brightest objects angularly close together -- because tonight is another Moon-Jupiter conjunction.<br/>
