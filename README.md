<h3>:rocket:M82: Galaxy with a Supergalactic Wind</h3>

<b>Description:</b> Why is the Cigar Galaxy billowing red smoke?  M82, as this starburst galaxy is also known, was stirred up by a recent pass near large spiral galaxy M81.  This doesn&#39;t fully explain the source of the red-glowing outwardly expanding gas and dust, however.  Evidence indicates that this gas and dust is being driven out by the combined emerging particle winds of many stars, together creating a galactic superwind.  The dust particles are thought to originate in M82&#39;s interstellar medium and are actually similar in size to particles in cigar smoke.  The featured photographic mosaic highlights a specific color of red light strongly emitted by ionized hydrogen gas, showing detailed filaments of this gas and dust.  The filaments extend for over 10,000 light years. The 12-million light-year distant Cigar Galaxy is the brightest galaxy in the sky in infrared light and can be seen in visible light with a small telescope towards the constellation of the Great Bear (Ursa Major).   APOD in world languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Beijing), Chinese (Taiwan), Croatian, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Indonesian, Japanese, Montenegrin, Polish, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian,  Spanish, Taiwanese, Turkish, and  Ukrainian<br/>
