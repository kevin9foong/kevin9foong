<h3>:rocket:Polaris and the Trail of Comet ZTF</h3> 
<img width="450" src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apod.nasa.gov&#x2F;apod&#x2F;image&#x2F;2302&#x2F;C2022E3(ZTF)Circumpolarv2comentada.jpg" /><br/>

<b>Description:</b> Stars trace concentric arcs around the North Celestial Pole in this three hour long night sky composite, recorded with a digital camera fixed to a tripod on January 31, near Ã€ger, Lleida, Spain. On that date Comet C&#x2F;2022 E3 (ZTF) was near its northernmost declination in planet Earth&#39;s sky. That put the comet about 10 degrees from Earth&#39;s North Celestial Pole making the comet&#39;s position circumpolar, always above the horizon, from all locations on planet Earth at more than 10 degrees northern latitude. In the startrail image, the extension of Earth&#39;s axis of rotation into space is at the left. North star Polaris traces the short, bright, concentric arc less than a degree from the North Celestial Pole. The trail of Comet ZTF is indicated at the right, its apparent motion mostly reflecting Earth&#39;s rotation like the stars. But heading for its closest approach to planet Earth on February 1, the comet is also moving significantly with respect to the background stars. The diffuse greenish trail of Comet ZTF is an almost concentric arc mingled with startrails as it sweeps through the long-necked constellation Camelopardalis.<br/>
